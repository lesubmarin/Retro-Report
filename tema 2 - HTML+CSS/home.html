                <p>
                    A German offensive along the entire Polish front started this morning, and several towns have been 
                    bombarded. An official at the Polish Embassy said: "I think the European War will start today. Poland will fight to the end for victory." 
                    Poland has now invoked the treaty with Britain.

                <h1 style="text-align: center;">Hitler's Order to the Army</h1>
            <p> Hitler talks of meeting force with force in a proclamation to the Army contained in an announcement issued by the official Berlin wireless station.
                It was stated from the station: "The Polish State has refused the peaceful settlement of relations which I desired and has appealed to arms". </p>
                In a chilling address to the nation, Adolf Hitler, the Chancellor of Germany, made a solemn declaration today that has sent shockwaves
                throughout the world. In a fiery speech delivered in Berlin, Hitler proclaimed the official commencement of hostilities as he outlined
                his vision for a new world order.
            <br><br>
                "Our great nation stands at the threshold of a historic struggle. The time for diplomacy has passed. We shall forge our destiny with
                unwavering resolve and determination. The German people are called upon to fulfill their duty to the Fatherland," declared Hitler.
            <br><br>
                As the world grapples with the unfolding crisis, Hitler's words cast a foreboding shadow, leaving many to wonder about the implications
                and consequences of this ominous pronouncement.

                <p>
                    In a shocking turn of events, the world has been plunged into chaos as World War II erupts with a series of unprecedented events.
                Reports confirm a widespread conflict involving major global powers. The ominous echoes of war are felt across continents, signaling
                a dark and uncertain period for humanity.
                <br><br>
                As nations mobilize their forces and tensions escalate, the specter of war casts a long shadow over the international community. The
                world braces itself for the challenges and hardships that lie ahead, as the headlines proclaim the beginning of a new era defined by
                conflict and struggle.
                <br><br>
                    In a surprising turn of events, the Soviet Union has responded to the escalating tensions in Europe with a series of decisive actions.
                    Reports confirm that Soviet forces have been mobilized along the western border, marking a significant development in the unfolding
                    drama of World War II.
                    <br><br>
                    Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin addressed the nation, stating, "The Soviet Union cannot remain indifferent to the current threats to
                    peace. We are committed to ensuring the security of our people and our allies. The Red Army stands ready to face any challenge that
                    comes our way."
                    <br><br>
                    As the world watches, the Soviet Union's entry into the conflict adds a new layer of complexity to the evolving global landscape,
                    raising questions about the alliances and strategies that will shape the course of this unprecedented war.
